# Opportunity Mapping

## Opportunity Solution Tree (OST)

An OST connects desired outcomes to opportunities to solution ideas:

```
Desired Outcome
  |
  +-- Opportunity 1 (score)
  |     +-- Solution Idea A
  |     +-- Solution Idea B
  |
  +-- Opportunity 2 (score)
  |     +-- Solution Idea C
  |
  +-- Opportunity 3 (score)
        +-- Solution Idea D
        +-- Solution Idea E
```

### Building the OST
1. Define desired outcome from customer research
2. Map opportunities from interview insights (minimum 5 distinct)
3. Score each opportunity using the Opportunity Algorithm
4. Generate solution ideas for top 2-3 opportunities
5. Seek real diversity in solutions (avoid variations of the same idea)

## Opportunity Scoring Algorithm

**Formula**: Score = Importance + Max(0, Importance - Satisfaction)

- Importance: 1-10 (how important is this to the customer?)
- Satisfaction: 1-10 (how satisfied are they with current solutions?)
- Max score: 20

### Interpretation
| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| >8 | High importance with satisfaction gap -- underserved need | Pursue |
| 5-8 | Moderate importance or partially served | Evaluate further |
| <5 | Low importance or well-served | Deprioritize |

### Scoring Process
1. Gather importance ratings from 5+ customer interviews
2. Gather satisfaction ratings for current solutions
3. Calculate scores per opportunity
4. Rank and select top 2-3 for solution ideation

## Job Mapping (JTBD)

### Universal Job Map Steps

| Step | Goal | Outcome Format |
|------|------|---------------|
| Define | Determine what needs to be done | Minimize time to identify [object] |
| Locate | Find inputs and information | Minimize time to gather [resources] |
| Prepare | Ready inputs for use | Minimize likelihood of missing [requirements] |
| Confirm | Verify readiness | Minimize likelihood of incorrect [categorization] |
| Execute | Perform the core task | Minimize time from [start] to [completion] |
| Monitor | Track progress | Minimize uncertainty about [status] |
| Modify | Adjust if needed | Minimize effort to correct [issues] |
| Conclude | Complete the job | Minimize time from [completion] to [result] |

### Outcome Statement Format
**[Direction] + [Metric] + [Object] + [Clarifier]**

Example: "Minimize the time it takes to identify which project budget a new expense should be allocated to"

### Job Map Example: Track Team Project Expenses

| Step | Goal | Desired Outcome |
|------|------|----------------|
| Define | Determine which expenses need tracking | Minimize time to identify expense categories for this project |
| Locate | Find expense data and receipts | Minimize time to gather all expense documentation |
| Prepare | Ready expenses for submission | Minimize likelihood of missing required fields |
| Confirm | Verify expense details correct | Minimize likelihood of incorrect categorization |
| Execute | Submit expenses for approval | Minimize time from submission to approval |
| Monitor | Track approval status | Minimize uncertainty about expense status |
| Modify | Adjust if rejected or questioned | Minimize effort to correct and resubmit |
| Conclude | Complete reimbursement cycle | Minimize time from approval to reimbursement |

## Lean Canvas

A one-page business model for validating market viability (Phase 4).

### Canvas Sections
1. **Problem**: Top 3 problems (validated in Phase 1)
2. **Customer Segments**: Target users segmented by job-to-be-done
3. **Unique Value Proposition**: Single clear compelling message
4. **Solution**: Top 3 features addressing top problems
5. **Channels**: Path to customers (validated in Phase 4)
6. **Revenue Streams**: How you make money
7. **Cost Structure**: Key costs
8. **Key Metrics**: Activity metrics that matter
9. **Unfair Advantage**: What cannot be easily copied

### 4 Big Risks
All must be addressed before proceeding to build:

| Risk | Question | Validation Method |
|------|----------|------------------|
| Value | Will customers want this? | Customer interviews, fake doors |
| Usability | Can customers use this? | Prototype testing, task completion |
| Feasibility | Can we build this? | Technical spikes, expert review |
| Viability | Does this work for our business? | Lean Canvas, stakeholder review |

## Technique Selection Guide

| Goal | Recommended Techniques |
|------|----------------------|
| Validate problem exists | Mom Test, Job Mapping |

| Prioritize opportunities | OST, Opportunity Algorithm |
| Generate solutions | Ideation with OST constraints |
| Validate solution value | Hypothesis Testing, Prototypes |
| Test usability | Prototype testing, Task completion |
| Assess feasibility | 4 Risks framework, Spikes |
| Structure business model | Lean Canvas |
| Continuous learning | Weekly customer touchpoints |
